Question: 
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 

Answer: In Java, you can't have multiple constructors with the same parameter types. Therefore, you can't create two constructors for the DigitalVideoDisc class, one takes a title as a parameter and another takes a category as a parameter, because they would have the same parameter type (String). However, you can use constructor overloading. You can have one constructor that takes a title and another constructor that takes a category with different additional parameters to distinguish between them.

Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Question: After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two 
objects still remain? 
Answer : Beacause eventhough the value of two objects inside the swap are changed, these changes are local to the method scope. The original references jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD remain unchanged.

Question: After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is 
the title of the JungleDVD changed? 

Answer: Because we are directly modifying the state of the original object.
